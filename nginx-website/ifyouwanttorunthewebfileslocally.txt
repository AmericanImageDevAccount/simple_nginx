# If you want to run this to serve webfiles that are stored locally and not
extracted from the git repo:

# 1 - Place the webfiles in this folder
#
# 2 - Modify docker-compose.yml
#     CHANGE: /vagrant/web:/usr/share/nginx/html
#     TO:     ./nginx-website:/usr/share/nginx/html
#
# 3 - If you are using a repo to select public repos to add to Vagrant:
#     remove the words DOCKER or WEB from the git_grab list.
#     Otherwise the function will erase your files when it replaces them with the github repos.
